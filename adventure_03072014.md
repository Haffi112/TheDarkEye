# Back story
The people in Trackenborn are suffering from some illness, called
Brabak fever and the sick have been quarantined in the Peraine temple.

## Day 3 after the trial
The goal was to have Mirio get the group in contact with his sister (one
of the witches) and ask her about the plague and whether she could be of
any help. Mirio suddenly awakes the group as it was sleeping in the inn and
announces breakfast (Tengwar was not amused and tried blocking the
door) and mentions that his sister had heeded his call and was in the
dining hall waiting.

The group starts asking his sister about Madalea and the plan to have
her magic burned out of her. She doesn't think it makes sense and
actually she was planning to offer her training. On the fever she says
that it can be healed but that would require a lot of magic energy.
She thinks that the fever originates from the swamps since it is also
called swamp fever. Before she leaves she mentions that if someone is
close to dying from the fever she can be summoned but she can only save
1-2 persons.

In the meantime Huor had continued growing Donf plants which can heal
people from the plague. Loki, Irion and Tul'achim intend to go to the
Peraine temple to get the news (Tengwar doesn't dare to go outside). On
the way Tul'achim suddenly sees a pack of wolves running towards him. He
starts running for the temple and Irion and Loki follow. As it turns out
he was hallucinating and had caught the fever. The total number of sick
are thus eight. The first four had been the mayor, the leatherer
(Alriq), the geese herder and the Peraine priest. Note that some of them
did not have bite marks on them which is one of the hallmark indicators
of the disease.

Loki offers his help and starts looking for more Donf with Huor while Irion
goes to the castle to tell the Praios priest there the news. He thinks
the curfew was a good idea and thinks we should just all wait for an
Anconite (a healing mage). He also contemplates whether the illness is
a curse of Praios, he has heard of such but dismisses it.

## Day 4 after the trial
Next day there are four new cases, amongst them the bartender from the
inn the group stays at, Hesintje from the castle library. Hurgol the
Peraine priest and the geese herder should start gaining consciousness
today.

Irion tries to calm people in the village down. Meanwhile Tengwar
starts making amulets out of stone which he believes will prevent the
disease. He manages to sell a few to inhabitants of the village.  The
rumor spreads and soon the townspeople are inquiring Irion about these
amulets and where they can be obtained (he notes down who wants them and
hands the list to Tengwar).

In the evening the guards start shouting that someone is coming. A
handsome curly and brown haired guy in a green vest enters the town. He
has scars in his face, one of his little fingers is missing, he has a
staff and Loki recognizes him as an Anconite. He introduces himself as
Andram Termoil from Albenhus. Irion realises that this is a dwarfen name
even though Andram is a human but he doesn't think about it further.
It is worth noting that we were also a bit surprised that he was alone
and not with more healing mages.

Andram is escorted to the temple where he meets Wilja who is taking care
of the sick. Then in the evening the priest and the geese herder wake up.
They had had terrible dreams.

## Day 5 after the trial

The next day we tried to figure out how they got infected, the priest
had been in the woods the day beforee so it was not unlikely that he had
been bitten. In the night three more got infected, one of them was
Frederick the brother of Medalia.  Loki tries to comfort Medalia because
she doesn't want to leave Frederick. After listening to his advice she
goes outside.

In a discussion with Andram he suggest emptying the swamps. Luckily Loki
has some herbs which prevent any infection for
two days. The group (now Irion, Loki and Tengwar) asks some strong men
to help them (they find two) and they get permission from the Praios
priest to leave town. Unfortunately there are many mosquitos which could
be harmful to the unprotected ones. Therefore Loki opens his vial with
the foul smelling plant and they all leave them alone. They dig for the
whole day to make a sewer which should empty the swamps. When they
return Pedora and Alrik have awakened. However Pedora is still not
feeling well, Wilja thinks she didn't handle the disease well.

## Day 6 after the trial

The next morning Wilja wakes the group up because in the night someone 
had destroyed her herb garden, which is just by the temple. She also
announces that there are three new cases, all so far had been treated by
Donf but the supplies if the group were running short and Huor could
not make an infinite amount of it.

Tengwar was not in a good mood after the digging the day before and
suggested burning down the swamp instead of emptying the water from it.
He set a tree on fire (which the others did not belief would work) and
it burned strongly. Surprisingly the fire did not go out of it, it did
spread to nearby trees but there it was not sustainable, probably
because the trees were so wet. Eventually the tree collapsed and it
almost hit Tengwar, lighting is hand on fire in the progress which he
could set out himself. The tree kept on burning after it collapsed but
the fire didn't spread, it seemed to have killed a lot of mosquitos in
the meantime as well.

The group finishes the ditch they had been digging. Now the water from
the swamp flows into the river and pollutes it. This was maybe not what
they wanted after all. The people of the town started needing to drink
form a well there instead now. When they return from the woods they get
the news that Tul'achim is recovering quickly but Wilja tells that her
grandfather, the Peraine priest is relapsing. He is hallucinating and
sees wolves and spiders. In general it seems to be the case that the
dreams amplified their sufferers fears. Surprisingly a lot of the cured
patients are relapsing, this was maybe not Brabak fever after all.

Surprised by these strange relapses Tul'achim decides to use breathe of
magic to detect magic in the viscinity. The anconite steps out of his
field of vision during the cast of the spell and was thus undetectable.
The current hypothesis of the group was now that this might be demon's
work and the anconite is a suspect.

The group consults with the Praios priest who simply thinks that the
anchorite stepped away to prevent his aura from disturbing the spell.
The Praios priest claimed to be able to detect demon forces but that
would take him a lot of time. The group asks him about the ever burning
tree and he does not seem to see a connection between it and the plague.

As a last resort Irion pretends to be sick to see if there is something
strange going on in the temple. During the night the anchorite touches
him and attempts to extract something from him and thus reveals himself.
Since Irion wasn't sick from the right disease the anchorite leaves but
Irion manages to get a glimpse of who was behind it all.

## Day 7 after the trial

While Irion "suffers" Tul'achim discovers demonic particles in the
river. He knows that a demon with these kind of particles can
shapeshift. The group thinks that the water supply might be tainted.

Tengwar goes to check on Irion who tells him everything which happened.
The others were fetching the Praios priest to inform him about the demon
particles.

Suddenly things start happening quickly, Tengwar runs outside and tells
the rest of the group the truth. Irion lights a torch an starts running
around manically, pretending to be still sick. This attracts the
attention of Andram who follows Irion outside and watches him run in
circles. Brother Beardrye (the Praios priest) is there with the others,
instead of using surprise he accuses Andram of being a demon.

Andram reveals himself and starts fighting. Everyone had applied weapon
balm from Loki on their weapons. Andram has tentacles growing out of
him.

There is a long fight and eventually Andram turns into dust.

After the group defeats Andram the Praios priest congratulates them. The
whole town had been watching them. However the demon particles are still
in the river.

## Day 8 after the trial

The next day the group follows the river to its source. There they
discover that everything has withered, it stinks and there is an unholy
plant growing there devoted to Amazeroth, the opponent of Hesinde, the
goddess of wisdom.

Tengwar starts chopping the head off the plant. He then starts digging
up the roots and discovers a human finger. Suddenly then a spirit of a
dwarf appears in the form of fire. His voice is like cracking fire. He
reliefs Tul'achim from the guilt of invading his grave since he killed this demon.
Tul'achim has a stone which contains the soul of the dwarf. The dwarf
offers to separate his soul into a splinter of the stone which the group
can dig under the unholy plant and plant a bloodelm there to vanquish
the unholy magic (the bloodelm needs some source to grow from and this
soul would suffice).

He also teaches Tul'achim how to use the stone. Huor manages to
**epically** plant the bloodelm.
